Answer 0:
Step 1: The Kickers scored 2 goals in the first period.

Step 2: The Kickers scored twice that amount in the second period, so they scored 2 * 2 = 4 goals in the second period.

Step 3: The Kickers scored a total of 2 + 4 = 6 goals.

Step 4: The Spiders scored half the amount that The Kickers scored in the first period, so they scored 2 / 2 = 1 goal in the first period.

Step 5: The Spiders scored twice the amount that The Kickers scored in the second period, so they scored 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second period.

Step 6: The Spiders scored a total of 1 + 8 = 9 goals.

Step 7: The total amount of goals both teams scored is 6 (The Kickers) + 9 (The Spiders) = 15 goals. 

Therefore, the total amount of goals both teams scored is 15.


Answer 1:
Step 1: Calculate the number of goals The Kickers scored in the first period.
The Kickers scored 2 goals in the first period.

Step 2: Calculate the number of goals The Kickers scored in the second period.
Twice the amount of goals in the first period = 2 * 2 = 4 goals in the second period.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of goals The Kickers scored.
Total goals = goals in the first period + goals in the second period = 2 + 4 = 6 goals.

Step 4: Calculate the number of goals The Spiders scored in the first period.
Half the amount of goals The Kickers scored in the first period = 2 / 2 = 1 goal in the first period.

Step 5: Calculate the number of goals The Spiders scored in the second period.
Twice the amount of goals The Kickers scored in the second period = 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second period.

Step 6: Calculate the total number of goals The Spiders scored.
Total goals = goals in the first period + goals in the second period = 1 + 8 = 9 goals.

Step 7: Calculate the total number of goals both teams scored.
Total goals = goals scored by The Kickers + goals scored by The Spiders = 6 + 9 = 15 goals.

Therefore, the total number of goals both teams scored is 15.

Answer 0:
Step 1: Calculate Mandy's age.
Mandy is 3 years old.

Step 2: Calculate her brother's age.
Her brother is 4 times as old as she is.
Brother's age = 4 * Mandy's age
Brother's age = 4 * 3
Brother's age = 12 years

Step 3: Calculate her sister's age.
Her sister is 5 years younger than her brother.
Sister's age = Brother's age - 5
Sister's age = 12 - 5
Sister's age = 7 years

Step 4: Calculate the age difference between Mandy and her sister.
Age difference = Sister's age - Mandy's age
Age difference = 7 - 3
Age difference = 4 years

Therefore, the age difference between Mandy and her sister is 4 years.


Answer 1:
Step 1: Let's first find out how old Mandy's brother is.
Since Mandy is 3 years old, her brother is 4 times as old as she is: 3 x 4 = 12 years old.

Step 2: Now, let's find out how old Mandy's sister is.
Mandy's sister is 5 years younger than her brother, who is 12 years old. So, her sister is 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Step 3: Finally, let's find the age difference between Mandy and her sister.
Mandy is 3 years old and her sister is 7 years old. The age difference is 7 - 3 = 4 years.

Therefore, the age difference between Mandy and her sister is 4 years.


Answer 2:
Step 1: Find Mandy's age.
Mandy is 3 years old.

Step 2: Find Mandy's brother's age.
Mandy's brother is 4 times as old as Mandy.
4 * 3 = 12
Mandy's brother is 12 years old.

Step 3: Find Mandy's sister's age.
Mandy's sister is 5 years younger than her brother.
12 - 5 = 7
Mandy's sister is 7 years old.

Step 4: Find the age difference between Mandy and her sister.
Mandy is 3 years old and her sister is 7 years old.
7 - 3 = 4

Therefore, the age difference between Mandy and her sister is 4 years.

Step 1: All three responses correctly determine Mandy's age as 3 years old.
