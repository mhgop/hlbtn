[Question]
Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?

[Candidate Answers]
A0: Step 1: Calculate the value of the house after repairs.   # <-- Each possible answer is generated individually by zero shot CoT
The increase in value is 150% of the original value. 
Increase = $80,000 * 150% = $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000
Value after repairs = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Step 2: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = Purchase price + Repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Value after repairs - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Josh made a profit of $70,000.


A1: Step 1: Calculate the increase in value of the house after repairs
The increase in value of the house after repairs is $80,000 * 150% = $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.

Step 2: Determine the total cost of the house after repairs
The total cost of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.

Step 3: Calculate the profit made by selling the house
The profit made by selling the house is the selling price minus the total cost, which is $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000.

Step 4: Interpret the result
Josh actually made a loss of $10,000 instead of a profit.


A2: Step 1: Calculate the increase in value of the house after repairs.
The original value of the house was $80,000.
The repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the value increased by 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000.

Step 2: Calculate the total value of the house after repairs.
The total value of the house after repairs is the original value plus the increase, so it is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Step 3: Calculate the profit made by selling the house.
Since Josh spent $80,000 to buy the house and $50,000 on repairs, his total investment was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
Therefore, his profit from selling the house is the total value of the house after repairs minus his total investment, which is $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000 by flipping the house.

[Comparison]
Let's compare the answers step by step.

Step 1:
- A0 correctly calculates the increase in value after repairs as $80,000 * 150% = $120,000.
- A1 also correctly calculates the increase in value after repairs as $80,000 * 150% = $120,000.
- A2 correctly calculates the increase in value after repairs as 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000.

Step 2:
- A0 correctly calculates the total cost after repairs as $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
- A1 incorrectly calculates the total cost after repairs as $130,000 instead of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
- A2 correctly calculates the total value after repairs as $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

Step 3:
- A0 correctly calculates the profit as $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.
- A1 incorrectly calculates the profit as $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000.
- A2 correctly calculates the profit as $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Based on the systematic comparison of the reasoning paths, the most sound and correct response is A0, followed by A2, and lastly, A1 due to the error in calculating the profit. 

Therefore, the best response is:
A0     # <-- Apply an extraction strategy with JSON formating to get the '0'

[Answer]
Expected answer: 70000 -- found 70000 -- correct: True  # <-- this is coded in python for quick check.

Step 1: Calculate the value of the house after repairs.  # <-- ensure that we could extract the correct index: we indeed disply the text of A0
The increase in value is 150% of the original value. 
Increase = $80,000 * 150% = $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000
Value after repairs = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000

Step 2: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = Purchase price + Repairs
Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Value after repairs - Total cost
Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000

Josh made a profit of $70,000.
